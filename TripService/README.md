# PHP

In order to perform the kata, first of all you will need to install all of the dependencies. 
This can be done using composer (standing from the *"php"* directory")

```shell
wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
php composer.phar install
```

Next, to execute the unit tests you need run this from the *php* directory

    php bin/phpunit

## Coverage

If your IDE doesn't handle it you can launch and visualize it from the command line. 
Given you are in  the *php* folder just run

    php bin/phpunit --coverage-text

If you want to visualize it from the browser you have to run PHPUnit with this parameters

    php bin/phpunit --coverage-html report/

Then visualize

    open report/index.html

in a browser

Enjoy
